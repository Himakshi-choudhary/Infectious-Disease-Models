INFECTIOUS DISEASE MODELS – COVID-19 SEIR MODELING & DATA ANALYSIS

This project presents a mathematical and data-driven study of COVID-19 dynamics using SEIR-based infectious disease models, real-world datasets, nonlinear parameter estimation, and reproduction number analysis.

The work integrates epidemiological modeling with data preprocessing and numerical simulations to understand disease transmission behavior, based on the MSc Phase I project report.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES

• Analyze real COVID-19 time-series data (India & Nigeria)
• Implement classical and extended SEIR models
• Estimate epidemiological parameters using Least Squares Method (LSM)
• Fit models to real cumulative case data
• Compute and interpret the basic reproduction number (R₀)

KEY FEATURES

✔ COVID-19 dataset cleaning and preprocessing
✔ SEIR and extended SEIR compartmental models
✔ Nonlinear least-squares parameter optimization
✔ Numerical simulations and curve fitting
✔ R₀ computation using next-generation approach
✔ Comparative regional analysis
